# Resistora

Resistora is a React project that helps solve the problem of reading resistor values from color bands. This project was created to make the workflow of my colleagues and I more efficient while working in the lab.

## Colorband Calculator

"Calculate resistor values quickly and accurately with Resistora's Colorband Calculator! in seconds, not minutes!".

## Problem

When working with resistors in the lab, it can be time-consuming to read the resistor value from the color bands. This process can be especially frustrating when working with many resistors at once. Resistora was created to alleviate this issue and make the workflow in the lab more efficient.

## Solution

Resistora's Colorband Calculator allows users to input the color bands of a resistor and quickly get the corresponding resistance value. The calculator also provides additional information such as tolerance and temperature coefficient.

## Usage

To use Resistora's Colorband Calculator, simply input the color bands of your resistor into the appropriate fields and click the "Calculate" button. The calculated resistance value, tolerance, and temperature coefficient will be displayed below.

## Acknowledgments

Resistora was created to solve a problem that my colleagues and I faced while working in the lab. I would like to acknowledge their input and feedback throughout the development process.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
